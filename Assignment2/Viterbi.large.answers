This program is not complete. I had a very hard time obtaining the data in ways needed, especially tag|tag. Below is a list of my process:
    1) Read in each line from file and the first file would be used for training while 2nd was for testing
    2) Process the training file and get rid of extra slashes for tag phrases
    3) split each line up by spaces, adding <s> to the beginning (assumed beginning of sentence was each  new line) and then by /
    4) assumed the second split resulted in a 2 item list, then added the tag at location 1 to a tag dict incremented the count for that tag
    4) Add word | tag as a tuple to the a dictionary called word_tag or incremented the count for that tuple
    5) Each tag at location 1 wsa then appended to an empty list in order it was read in so a bigram of tags could be made
    6) obtained the probabilities for word
