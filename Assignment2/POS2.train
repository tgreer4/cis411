Behind/IN all/DT the/DT hoopla/NN is/VBZ some/DT heavy-duty/JJ competition/NN ./. 
As/IN individual/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP turned/VBN away/RB from/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, securities/NNS firms/NNS have/VBP scrambled/VBN to/TO find/VB new/JJ products/NNS that/WDT brokers/NNS find/VBP easy/JJ to/TO sell/VB ./.

The/DT reason/NN :/: Share/NN prices/NNS of/IN many/JJ of/IN these/DT funds/NNS this/DT year/NN have/VBP climbed/VBN much/RB more/RBR sharply/RB than/IN the/DT foreign/JJ stocks/NNS they/PP hold/VBP ./.
